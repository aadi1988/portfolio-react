             I am a software engineer currently working at Cisco. I test various protocols like BGP that drive the internet on routers and switches.
             Safe to say I connect people &#128540;! I like learning new things and keeping myself updated on new technologies.I love reading books and watching tv shows and movies.
             I take any opportunity I get to give back too. Taking part in volunteering activities is one of my favorite things to do! Hope to see you guys on the other side.!
