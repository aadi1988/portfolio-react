      About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am a software engineer currently working at Cisco. I test various protocols like BGP that drive the internet on routers and switches. Safe to say I connect people ðŸ˜œ! I like learning new things and keeping myself updated on new technologies.I love reading books and watching tv shows and movies. I take any opportunity I get to give back too. Taking part in volunteering activities is one of my favorite things to do! Hope to see you guys on the other side.!
